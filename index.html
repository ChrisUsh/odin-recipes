        <p>The gastronomy of Brazil can best be described as a combination of European, African and indigenous Amerindian influences.  The typical cuisine enjoyed by Brazilians varies greatly from region to region, reflecting the nation’s mixture of native and immigrant populations, as well as its vast continental size.  This has created a national cuisine characterized by the careful and deliberate preservation of the country’s regional differences.</p>
