        <p>Chances are high you encountered Brazil’s 
            national drink, the Caipirinha, if you’ve traveled 
            to the South American country. Refreshing and easy
            to make, the cocktail contains fresh lime juice, 
            sugar and cachaça—a spirit as central to Brazilian 
            identity as samba, soccer and carnival. 
            Cachaça is also the country’s national spirit,
            inextricably tying this drink to its home. </p>
